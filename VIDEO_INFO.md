# 🎬 Embedded Video Information

## Current Setup
All exercises now have **embedded YouTube videos** that play directly in the app!

### What You'll See:
- ✅ **Embedded videos** play right in each exercise card (16:9 aspect ratio, 256px height)
- ✅ **"YouTube" button** in top-right corner to open video in new tab if needed
- ✅ **"Show Image" button** to toggle to static image view
- ✅ **Automatic fallback** - if a video fails to load, it shows the image with a "Show Video" button to retry

## Video Sources
All videos are from **HEP2go** and **Physiotutors** channels:
- These are professional physical therapy channels
- Videos are designed for medical/exercise instruction
- Most allow embedding (but YouTube's policies can change)

---

## If a Video Shows "Unavailable"
Some videos may become unavailable due to:
- YouTube embedding restrictions
- Region blocking
- Video being deleted or made private
- Copyright issues

**Solution:**
1. Click the **"YouTube" button** to watch directly on YouTube
2. Click **"Show Image"** to see the static exercise image instead
3. The image + written instructions are always available as backup

---

## Offline Mode
- **Videos require internet** to stream
- **Images work offline** after first load
- The app automatically falls back to images when offline
- All instructions, tips, and completion tracking work offline

---

## Notes
- Videos are embedded using YouTube's iframe embed
- Some videos may not be available in all regions
- The app intelligently handles video errors
- You can always toggle between video and image view
