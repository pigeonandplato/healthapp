## 📊 Your 5 Phases

### **Phase 1 (Weeks 1–4): Foundation**
**Goal**: Calm disc + build base capacity  
**Running**: NONE (elliptical/peloton/walking only)  
**Focus**:
- Spine hygiene + McGill core endurance
- Knee-friendly quad/glute work (step-ups, bridges, calves)
- Daily hip maintenance (12 min non-negotiable!)
- Ulnar nerve care (gentle glides + ergonomics)

**Gates to P2**:
- ✅ Walk 40 min comfortably
- ✅ No back flare >24h after strength
- ✅ Step-down small range pain ≤3/10

---

### **Phase 2 (Weeks 5–8): Build**
**Goal**: Strength + impact readiness  
**Running**: Still NONE (incline walk + elliptical)  
**Focus**:
- Progress step-down range
- Add supported split squats
- Anti-rotation work (Pallof press)
- Continue daily hip work

**Gates to P3**:
- ✅ Step-down 6–8" × 8/side pain ≤3/10
- ✅ Supported split squat × 8/side pain ≤3/10
- ✅ 2×15 slow calf raises pain ≤3/10

---

### **Phase 3 (Weeks 9–12): Return to Run**
**Goal**: Start run-walk intervals  
**Running**: Run-walk 2–3×/week (if gates met!)  
**Progression**:
- Week 1: Walk 4min / Jog 1min × 6–8
- Week 2: Walk 3 / Jog 1 × 8
- Week 3: Walk 2 / Jog 1 × 10
- Week 4: Walk 2 / Jog 2 × 8

**Focus**:
- Keep strength 2×/week minimum
- Maintain daily hip work
- Monitor symptoms strictly

**Gates to P4**:
- ✅ No knee swelling after run-walk
- ✅ Back stable or improving

---

### **Phase 4 (Weeks 13–18): Continuous Running**
**Goal**: Build to continuous 5K  
**Running**: Move from intervals → 20 min continuous → 30+ min  
**Focus**:
- Gradually increase long run
- Keep strength for injury prevention
- Build aerobic capacity

**Gates to P5**:
- ✅ 20 min continuous easy run
- ✅ Strength 2×/week maintained

---

### **Phase 5 (Weeks 19–24): Durability**
**Goal**: Comfortable 5K + injury resistance  
**Running**: 2 easy + 1 quality-lite session  
**Focus**:
- Add strides or gentle intervals
- Make it sustainable
- Reduce injury risk

**End Goal**:
- ✅ Comfortable continuous 5K
- ✅ Controlled symptoms
- ✅ Ready for ongoing training

---

## 🔥 Daily Hip Maintenance (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

**Every single day** (12 minutes):
1. **90/90 Hip Stretch** - 2 × 60s per side
2. **Figure-4 Stretch** - 2 × 60s per side
3. **Lacrosse Ball Glute Massage** - 3 min per side
4. **Child's Pose + Circles** - 2 min

**Why daily?**
Your L4-L5 disc + sitting = deep glutes (piriformis, gemelli, obturator) chronically tight. Daily work prevents nerve irritation and keeps hip mobile.

---

## 📏 Progression Rules (CRITICAL!)

Use 0–10 pain scale:

### **Green Light** (progress normally)
- Pain ≤ 2/10 during exercise
- Back to baseline by next morning
- No symptom increase

### **Yellow** (hold current level)
- Pain 3–4/10 or stiffness into next day
- Keep same intensity 1 more week
- Don't progress yet

### **Red** (reduce volume/intensity)
- Pain ≥ 5/10
- Sharp/radiating pain
- Increased tingling/numbness
- Pain lasting >24–48h
→ Drop volume/intensity 30–50%, reassess

### For Running
- Increase total weekly running time by **≤10%**
- If symptoms flare, hold or step back

## 🗓️ Weekly Template

**Example Week:**
- **Mon**: Strength A (Core/Glutes) + Hip work
- **Tue**: Cardio (Elliptical/Walk/Run-walk) + Hand care
- **Wed**: Strength B (Knee capacity) + Hip work
- **Thu**: Cardio + Hand care
- **Fri**: Strength C (Mobility/Hinge) + Hip work
- **Sat**: Longer cardio session
- **Sun**: Hip work + easy movement only

**Day A/B/C** auto-rotates so you don't repeat the same workout.

## ⚙️ How to Reset Program

If you need to restart (e.g., injury setback, long break):

1. Go to `/program` page
2. Click **"Settings"** button (top right)
3. Click **"Reset to Week 1"**
4. Your workout history stays, but program restarts from Week 1

Alternatively, manually edit start date in IndexedDB `settings` store → key: `programStartDate`

## 🚨 Safety Flags (Get Evaluated If...)

### **Back (L4-L5)**
- ⚠️ New/worsening leg weakness
- ⚠️ Foot drop
- ⚠️ Saddle numbness
- ⚠️ Bowel/bladder changes
- ⚠️ Rapidly worsening neurological symptoms

### **Knee (Old ACL)**
- ⚠️ True locking (not just noise)
- ⚠️ Giving-way episodes
- ⚠️ Significant swelling after activity
- ⚠️ Pain that doesn't respond to load management

### **Hand (Ulnar Nerve)**
- ⚠️ Weak grip (can't hold things)
- ⚠️ Worsening numbness
- ⚠️ Night symptoms waking you up
- ⚠️ Symptoms spreading beyond pinky/ring finger

→ Get evaluated by PT/sports med if any of these occur

## 📝 Tips for Success

1. **Start conservatively** - The gates are there for a reason
2. **Do the hip work EVERY day** - It's only 12 min and prevents flare-ups
3. **Don't skip strength when you start running** - Injury prevention!
4. **Track symptoms** - Use the notes field in each exercise
5. **Be patient** - 24 weeks seems long, but rushing = re-injury

---

## 🆘 Quick FAQ

**Q: Can I skip ahead if I feel good?**
A: NO. The gates exist because tissues need time to adapt. Feeling good ≠ tissue ready.

**Q: I missed a week, what do I do?**
A: The program continues automatically. Just pick up where the calendar is. If you missed >2 weeks, consider repeating the current phase.

**Q: Can I do extra workouts?**
A: Recovery is part of training. Stick to the plan. More ≠ better, especially with your history.

**Q: When do I START running?**
A: Only after completing ALL Phase 2 gates for 2 consecutive weeks. Likely Week 9–10.

**Q: Videos still not working?**
A: Some YouTube embed restrictions can't be fixed. Always use "YouTube" button or "Show Image" as backups.
